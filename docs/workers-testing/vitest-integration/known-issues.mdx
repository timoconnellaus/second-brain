description: Explore the known issues associated with the Workers Vitest integration.

---

The Workers Vitest pool is currently in open beta. The following are issues Cloudflare is aware of and fixing:

### Coverage

Native code coverage via [V8](https://v8.dev/blog/javascript-code-coverage) is not supported. You must use instrumented code coverage via [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) instead. Refer to the [Vitest Coverage documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/coverage) for setup instructions.

### Fake timers

Vitest's [fake timers](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking.html#timers) do not apply to KV, R2 and cache simulators. For example, you cannot expire a KV key by advancing fake time.

### Dynamic `import()` statements with `SELF` and Durable Objects

Dynamic `import()` statements do not work inside `export default { ... }` handlers when writing integration tests with `SELF`, or inside Durable Object event handlers. You must import and call your handlers directly, or use static `import` statements in the global scope.

### Durable Object alarms

Durable Object alarms are not reset between test runs and do not respect isolated storage. Ensure you delete or run all alarms with [`runDurableObjectAlarm()`](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/test-apis/#durable-objects) scheduled in each test before finishing the test.

### WebSockets

Using WebSockets with Durable Objects with the [`isolatedStorage`](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/isolation-and-concurrency) flag turned on is not supported. You must set `isolatedStorage: false` in your `vitest.config.ts` file.

### Isolated storage

When the `isolatedStorage` flag is enabled (the default), the test runner will undo any writes to the storage at the end of the test as detailed in the [isolation and concurrency documentation](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/isolation-and-concurrency/). However, Cloudflare recommends that you consider the following actions to avoid any common issues:

#### Await all storage operations

Always `await` all `Promise`s that read or write to storage services.

```ts
// Example: Seed data
beforeAll(async () => {
	await env.KV.put('message', 'test message');
	await env.R2.put('file', 'hello-world');
});
```

#### Explicitly signal resource disposal

When calling RPC methods of a Service Worker or Durable Object that return non-primitive values (such as objects or classes extending `RpcTarget`), use the `using` keyword to explicitly signal when resources can be disposed of. See [this example test](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/fixtures/vitest-pool-workers-examples/rpc/test/unit.test.ts#L155) and refer to [explicit-resource-management](/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/lifecycle#explicit-resource-management) for more details.

```ts
using result = await stub.getCounter();
```

#### Consume response bodies

When making requests via `fetch` or `R2.get()`, consume the entire response body, even if you are not asserting its content. For example:

```ts
test('check if file exists', async () => {
	await env.R2.put('file', 'hello-world');
	const response = await env.R2.get('file');

	expect(response).not.toBe(null);
	// Consume the response body even if you are not asserting it
	await response.text()
});
```

### Missing properties on `ctx.exports`

The `ctx.exports` property provides access to the exports of the main (`SELF`) Worker. The Workers Vitest integration attempts to automatically infer these exports by statically analyzing the Worker source code using esbuild. However, complex build setups, such as those using virtual modules or wildcard re-exports that esbuild cannot follow, may result in missing properties on the `ctx.exports` object.

For example, consider a Worker that re-exports an entrypoint from a virtual module using a wildcard export:

```ts
// index.ts
export * from "@virtual-module";
```

In this case, any exports from `@virtual-module` (such as `MyEntrypoint`) cannot be automatically inferred and will be missing from `ctx.exports`.

To work around this, add the `additionalExports` option to your Vitest configuration:

```ts
import { defineWorkersConfig } from "@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers/config";

export default defineWorkersConfig({
	test: {
		poolOptions: {
			workers: {
				wrangler: { configPath: "./wrangler.toml" },
				additionalExports: {
					MyEntrypoint: "WorkerEntrypoint",
				},
			},
		},
	},
});
```

The `additionalExports` option is a map where keys are the export names and values are the type of export (`"WorkerEntrypoint"`, `"DurableObject"`, or `"WorkflowEntrypoint"`).

### Module resolution

If you encounter module resolution issues such as: `Error: Cannot use require() to import an ES Module` or `Error: No such module`, you can bundle these dependencies using the [deps.optimizer](https://vitest.dev/config/#deps-optimizer) option:

```tsx
import { defineWorkersConfig } from "@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers/config";

export default defineWorkersConfig({
	test: {
		deps: {
			optimizer: {
				ssr: {
					enabled: true,
					include: ["your-package-name"],
				},
			},
		},
		poolOptions: {
			workers: {
				// ...
			},
		},
	},
});
```

You can find an example in the [Recipes](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/recipes) page.

### Importing modules from global setup file

Although Vitest is set up to resolve packages for the [`workerd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd) runtime, it runs your global setup file in the Node.js environment. This can cause issues when importing packages like [Postgres.js](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/6465), which exports a non-Node version for `workerd`.
To work around this, you can create a wrapper that uses Vite's SSR module loader to import the global setup file under the correct conditions. Then, adjust your Vitest configuration to point to this wrapper. For example:

```ts
// File: global-setup-wrapper.ts
import { createServer } from "vite"

// Import the actual global setup file with the correct setup
const mod = await viteImport("./global-setup.ts")

export default mod.default;

// Helper to import the file with default node setup
async function viteImport(file: string) {
  const server = await createServer({
    root: import.meta.dirname,
    configFile: false,
    server: { middlewareMode: true, hmr: false, watch: null, ws: false },
    optimizeDeps: { noDiscovery: true },
    clearScreen: false,
  });
  const mod = await server.ssrLoadModule(file);
  await server.close();
  return mod;
}
```

```ts
// File: vitest.config.ts
import { defineWorkersConfig } from "@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers/config";

export default defineWorkersConfig({
	test: {
		// Replace the globalSetup with the wrapper file
		globalSetup: ["./global-setup-wrapper.ts"],
		poolOptions: {
			workers: {
				// ...
			},
		},
	},
});
```
