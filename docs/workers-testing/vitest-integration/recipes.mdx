Recipes are examples that help demonstrate how to write unit tests and integration tests for Workers projects using the [`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers) package.

- [Basic unit and integration tests for Workers using `SELF`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/fixtures/vitest-pool-workers-examples/basics-unit-integration-self)
