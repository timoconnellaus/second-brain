The Workers platform has a variety of ways to test your applications, depending on your requirements. We recommend using the [Vitest integration](/workers/testing/vitest-integration), which allows you to run tests _inside_ the Workers runtime, and unit test individual functions within your Worker.

## Testing comparison matrix

However, if you don't use Vitest, both [Miniflare's API](/workers/testing/miniflare/writing-tests) and the [`unstable_startWorker()`](/workers/wrangler/api/#unstable_startworker) API provide options for testing your Worker in any testing framework.
